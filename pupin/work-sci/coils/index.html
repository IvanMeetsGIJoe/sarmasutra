	<p>Pupin's 1899 patent for <strong>loading coils</strong>, archaically called "Pupin coils",
	followed closely on the pioneering work of the English physicist and mathematician <strong>
	Oliver Heaviside</strong>, which predates Pupin's patent by some seven years. The importance
	of the patent was made clear when the American rights to it were acquired by American
	Telephone &amp; Telegraph (AT&amp;T), making him wealthy. Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent,
	they made little use of it, as they already had their own development in hand led by <strong>
	George Campbell</strong> and had up to this point been challenging Pupin with Campbell's own
	patent. AT&T were afraid they would lose control of an invention which was immensely valuable
	due to its ability to greatly extend the range of long distance telephones and especially
	submarine ones.</p>
